        My blog talks a little about some of my interests and happenings, but doesn't describe what I'm actually doing 
        day-to-day. I aim to update this page relatively frequently to tell you what I'm currently up to in and outside of 
        work.

      <ul>
        <li>My son, Ben, was born just over a month ago - learning how to be a Dad has been the most rewarding experience of my life so far, and I'm looking forward to having a lot of extended time off from the end of this month until January.</li>
        <li>Finishing up a few tasks in the next 3 weeks at Booking.com before I head off on extended paternity, but looking forward to 2025!</li>
        <li>My travelling has been limited to the kitchen and back, but I am heading to Amsterdam for a few days in just over a week.</li>
        <li>Jenkins is now closed down and everything is on GitHub Actions.</li>
        <li>I continue to use AWS for hosting, but the costs are getting a bit high. As a project while I'm off, I'm going to move back to VMs or a different/cheaper cloud provider to cut down on the bills a bit.</li>
        <li>My Land Rover Discovery was stolen and I haven't replaced it, for now we're making do with my 3-door Honda Civic Type-R while I consider what I want next as a family car.</li>
        <li>Watching the Fallout TV series, I've followed the same path as many and have started playing Fallout 4 when I have a spare minute, this time trying Survival mode which has been good fun.</li>
        <li>Our new kitchen is installed, I'm now planning for the downstairs rooms and then our house will have been completely finished!</li>
