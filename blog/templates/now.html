        My blog talks a little about some of my interests and happenings, but doesn't describe what I'm actually doing 
        day-to-day. I aim to update this page relatively frequently to tell you what I'm currently up to in and outside of 
        work.

      <ul>
        <li>Excitedly preparing for the arrival of our baby son in early June.</li>
        <li>Celebrating 1 year at Booking.com, where I'm continuing to help improve developer experience for teams across the company.</li>
        <li>Travelling very often to Amsterdam, London or Manchester with work.</li>
        <li>After a long think, moving away from Jenkins and slowly migrating all of my public and private projects to GitHub Actions.</li>
        <li>Thinking long and hard whether I want to give up either of my cars when our baby arrives, or whether we can live with a 3-door car.</li>
        <li>Planning for a bit of a refresh on the Civic, which needs a rear axle, some top suspension mounts and some cosmetic improvements.</li>
        <li>Using the Discovery more often as it's hit a period of reliability, epsecially to haul things and park at the airport.</li>
        <li>Not playing much in the way of games these days, although I was enjoying Skyrim for a while.</li>
        <li>Planning for our new kitchen, which we have a very strict time limit on before baby arrives.</li>
      </ul>
