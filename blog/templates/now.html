      <p>
        My blog talks a little about some of my interests and happenings, but doesn't describe what I'm actually doing 
        day-to-day. I aim to update this page relatively frequently to tell you what I'm currently up to in and outside of 
        work.

      <ul>
        <li>Finished up at Tesco Bank recently, starting as a principal software engineer at Booking.com and looking forward to using all my skills on a new challenge.</li>
        <li>Working on a new (and currently secret) side project when I have a little bit of spare time.</li>
        <li>Keeping on top of my weight and fresh air lately by making sure I get out for a decent walk every day; come rain, shine or forgotten house keys.</li>
        <li>Still enjoying driving the Civic Type-R as the main car, although there are now a couple of cosmetic fixes it needs.</li>
        <li>Waiting on the Discovery coming back from its MOT work where it should be in a good place to keep going for the rest of the year.</li>
        <li>Still learning about GitHub Actions and wondering if I can finally make the switch away from Jenkins, making sure I try a couple of alternatives such as GoCD too.</li>
        <li>Playing the occasional bit of GTA Online and Goldeneye 007 on the Switch recently.</li>
        <li>Finishing off the renovations on our first floor. We have no heating on the whole floor right now, so we're living on a mattress in my office/loft right now.</li>
      </ul>
