        My blog talks a little about some of my interests and happenings, but doesn't describe what I'm actually doing 
        day-to-day. I aim to update this page relatively frequently to tell you what I'm currently up to in and outside of 
        work.

      <ul>
        <li>I've now been on paternity leave for a little over 3 months, spending my days bonding with my son, and will be returning to work in January.</li>
        <li>I'm keeping apprised with all the Developer Experience and DevOps updates in the meantime to stay current.</li>
        <li>The blog has been moved into DigitalOcean from AWS, it's much cheaper and more convenient - AWS encouraged too much overkill in the solutions I was building.</li>
        <li>Hatching plans to build a home server that does a little more than file storage, but for that I need to build something - I haven't done that for a while!</li>
        <li>Trying to spend more time on <a href="https://howdee.social/@jamiefdhurst" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> and way less on <a href="https://x.com/jamiefdhurst" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a>, I'm not far away from closing that account now.</li>
        <li>We're down to a single car: a sensible silver Volvo V40. The 3-door boy-racer Honda was too impractical and needed to go, so my project car days are on hold for a while.</li>
        <li>In my downtime, I'm playing through a lot of Zelda games on my Switch. I've not finished the emulated Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, along with the Link's Awakening remake, and I'm about halfway through completing Breath of the Wild.</li>
        <li>Our house is completely finished! We're now furnishing the final rooms and planning how we're going to tackle the garden in 2025.</li>
      </ul>
